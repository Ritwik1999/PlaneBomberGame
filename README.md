# PlaneBomberGame

I have tried to recreate the classical plane bomber game with minimal features, just to explore vanilla JS.

### Features:
The player has an initial score of 2000.
It decreases continuously, unless the player hits the base.
Number of levels can be specified by the player, and the player can also control the speed and position of the plane.
